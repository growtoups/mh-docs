Sometimes Micium-Hosting#5933 (Bot) Will give you errors.

An Example:

![](/screenshot-2022-12-07-8-23-16-pm.png)

These are just the general errors of the bot. If the servers are full of allocations/ports the bot will give you this error message:

![](/screenshot-2022-12-07-8-32-37-pm.png)

Please note that the bot will sometimes not respond to commands for a period of time. Since the ping of the bot can spike up from 1 ms to 30 ms in a second. If you run into these errors, please do not ping staff members. If the bot is OFFLINE, then you may ping staff.
